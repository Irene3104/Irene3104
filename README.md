# Hey, I'm Seoyoon (Irene) 👋

Full-stack developer based in Sydney 🇦🇺

I like building things that actually get used. My proudest project is **Bee-Time**, a QR attendance system I built from scratch that's now running live across 5 real stores.

Right now I'm at a Japanese startup (Ten-X), leading development of **SAIXAN**, an AI-powered financial management system on Firebase and Google Cloud.

Open to mid-level full-stack roles in Sydney. If you're building something interesting, I'd love to chat.
